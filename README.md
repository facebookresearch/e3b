# Exploration via Elliptical Episodic Bonuses

This repo contains code for the E3B algorithm described in the NeurIPS 2022 paper [Exploration via Elliptical Episodic Bonuses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05805) by Mikael Henaff, Roberta Raileanu, Minqi Jiang and Tim Rocktäschel, as well as the ICML 2023 paper [A Study of Global and Episodic Bonuses for Exploration in Contextual MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03236) by Mikael Henaff, Minqi Jiang and Roberta Raileanu. 

E3B is an exploration algorithm designed for contextual MDPs, where the environment changes every episode. Examples of contextual MDPs include procedurally-generated environments such as MiniGrid, MiniHack, NetHack, ProcGen, and embodied AI settings such as Habitat where the agent finds itself in a new indoor space each episode.

The algorithm is simple to implement and operates using an elliptical bonus computed at the episode level, in a feature space induced by an inverse dynamics model.

## Running the code

Code to run E3B on MiniHack and Vizdoom uses IMPALA as the base RL algorithm and is contained in the `minihack` folder. Code to run E3B on Habitat uses DD-PPO and is in the `habitat-lab` folder. Please see the README files in each folder for further instructions.
